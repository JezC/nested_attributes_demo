Not Yet Ready For Prime Time

Now has routes, and has_many, nested attributes declarations, before_filters. No Controller actions yet. Added YUI CSS and JS.

This demo app is part of a tutorial about nested RESTful apps. Think "/cars/1/engines/4/fuel_types/3" and "/cars/1/seats/4/safety_features/219". It is partially a note for myself about things that worked, and partly a note for trainees. 

It is markedly missing the tests from Test Driven Design... which I may get around to fixing in a new branch, as a demo of that, too :)
